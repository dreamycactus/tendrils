This folder contains levels and packages of arts we've made

To run these levels you first need to upload the packages(.UPK) to the udk.

In the static_and_skeletal_mesh level, we've added all the preset static meshes we are goin to use. The rusted pipes, barrels, fence, doors and tanks are gonna be used in our 2nd level which is situated in the sewers of the spaceship.The water material is gonna be the material used for poddles in the sewers. the plants are gonna be used to decorate the spaceships laboratory in level 4.This plants are alien plants which are under experiement.The wires, the barrels, the circular blue light and some of the pipes will be used to decorate most of the levels. All these static meshes are preset udk meshes. 

 
In the static_and_skeletal_mesh level, we've also included two skeletal meshes. The Humanoid shape skeletal mesh was sculpted using a Mudbox preset by us. This mesh will be the base for our main characters, our robot soldiers, our zombies and our bosses.The second skeletal mesh is a sphere-like drone. This model was made in 3ds max by us. Both these meshes can be found in the Bryan.upk

The folder includes sections of our levels which will be used by our procedurally generated mapping mechanic. Level2 has the textures we are considering using, which is a udk preset. level22 also includes some more preset static meshes and texture we are goin to use. Section02,Section03 and Section04 are other level sections (basic shape) which we are gonna use to make each levels.

For sounds, we are mostly gonna use preset udk sound with the addition to some sounds we found on Freesound.org. These sound can be found in the sound folder.
